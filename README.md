Spend less time with Redmine time tracking.
* no need to login again because your session has expired
* check your time entries with a simple click/hotkey
* change or create a copy of a time entry with the speed of light

Security
--------

Redmine projects/issues/activities and time entries are cached in local IndexedDB.
Except the `id`s and some date properties (`updated_on`, `closed_on`, etc.) everything else is stored encrypted.
The key is saved in a cookie under the configured Redmine URL.
Basically it is as secure as any other cookie in the browser.
